create a work flow

problem wise pattern identification
group problems into patterns
create a solution for each pattern
create a work flow for each pattern

break the prblem into functional requirements and non functional requirements
functional requirements are the features that the system should have
non functional requirements are the performance, scalability, security, etc.

solve each functional requirement with a solution
    identify the patterns, connect with the solution for the pattern, and implement the solution
    for each FR we can have multiple approaches, name each approach, approach no in logical order
    make a brain map of the solution and the patterns used in the solution

solve each non functional requirement with a solution
    identify the patterns, connect with the solution for the pattern, and implement the solution
    make a brain map of the solution and the patterns used in the solution

after solving all the functional and non functional requirements,
    give a table to show the scale at which each solution can be implemented, the pros and cons of each solution, and the patterns used in each solution


make a easy to understand document for each solution and the patterns used in the solution
add mermaid diagrams for the solution and the patterns used in the solution
 sequence diagrams, class diagrams, component diagrams, etc.



At the end generate a quiz for each question and answer for each question
